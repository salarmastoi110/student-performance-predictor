# 🎓 Student Performance Predictor

This is a Machine Learning project that predicts student performance (Pass/Fail) based on various academic and lifestyle factors such as study hours, health, sleep, and parental support.

## 📌 Project Highlights
- Built using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Scikit-learn**
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand key factors
- Implemented **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Tree Classifier**
- Evaluated models with accuracy, precision, and confusion matrix

## 📂 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle or UCI Repository]
- Contains features like:
  - `study_hours`
  - `health`
  - `sleep_duration`
  - `parental_support`
  - `attendance`
  - `exam_result` (target)

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python 🐍
- Pandas 🐼
- NumPy 📊
- Scikit-learn 🤖
- Matplotlib & Seaborn 📉
- Jupyter Notebook 💻

## 📊 Model Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
3. **Model Building**
4. **Evaluation**

## 📈 Sample Result
Model Accuracy: 87%
Confusion Matrix:
[[56 4]
 [6 34]]
